## ✅ Conventional Commits

This project uses [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) and [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) to enforce conventional commit messages.

### Make a proper commit:

```bash
npm run commit
```

Or add all staged files and commit interactively:

```bash
npm run commit:all
```

> All commit messages are validated against the `conventional-changelog` standard.

---

### Commit Message Format

Commit messages should follow the format:
`type(scope): message`

Allowed types:

```
build: Changes that affect the build system or dependencies
chore: Miscellaneous changes that don’t modify source or test files
ci: Continuous integration-related changes
docs: Documentation only changes
feat: A new feature
fix: A bug fix
perf: A code change that improves performance
refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
revert: Reverts a previous commit
style: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
test: Adding or correcting tests
```

Examples:

```
feat(auth): add Google login
fix(api): handle 404 error on fetch
docs(readme): add commit instructions
chore(deps): update eslint and prettier
```

---

## 🔍 Linting and Formatting

ESLint and Prettier are integrated using lint-staged and husky.
Run lint manually:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Auto-run on commit:
`lint-staged` automatically formats and lints staged files before every commit.

### Run lint manually:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## 🛠️ Post-clone Setup

After cloning the repository and installing dependencies, run:

```bash
npx husky install
```

## This ensures Git hooks are correctly set up.

## Authentication

To enable Auth0 authentication, copy `.env-exempla` to `.env.local` and set the following variables:

```bash
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-auth0-client-id
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=your-auth0-client-secret
AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL=https://your-auth0-domain
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

The app uses [next-auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) with the Auth0 provider. Update these values with your Auth0 application credentials.
